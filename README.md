# Trakr: An open-source, self-hosted Toggl clone

## Description

I got annoyed with Toggl's new API changes and said "how hard can it be". Turns out, like, kind of? But anyway here it is. This is the repository for the self hosted/server side of Trakr. The desktop app is in progress, but the server side was designed with Toggl interoperability in mind, as a relatively drop in replacement. Therefore, the open source Toggl app that was deprecated a while ago should work for now.
